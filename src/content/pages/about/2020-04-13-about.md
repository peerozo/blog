### A warm hello from Peerozo's team!
We are a tech-based startup mainly aiming to solve problems faced by students in hostels. We are committed to direct the hostel culture towards a more comfortable home, upgrading the style of living with amenities you deserve. **Quality living space, Food, Management, and Security** are the four pillars for a complete home away from home, and our mission is to provide the best quality of all four!

#### The Team

We have been in your shoes, leaving our hometown and settling into an environment completely out of the comfort zone. Through this startup, we strive to make this confrontation trouble-free for you through the conjunction of the tech and physical presence-based solutions.*
