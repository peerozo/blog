Apart from our personal gains & losses. It's most important to understand how you're going to contribute to a moral solution. Getting away from home is always a daunting experience for everyone (especially young ones). Changed schedule,  doing all arrangements by themselves, academic/ work backlog, distant touch from family results in stress and all pile up into a Home-Sick person. We all experience such reckless feelings in our lifetime, some get adapted soon and for some it damages productivity and causes failures.

Along with you support, We will nurture them, by:
> Giving them homely experience along with standard facilities (no compromise on the facilities is Peerozo’s top priority).<br/>
> Providing them personal assistance and a parent connect facility to share all their problems with. <br/>
> Platform for 24*7 counselling  & support whenever they need.<br/>
