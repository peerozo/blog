### Parenting made easy and reliable
*When a child goes away from home it is very disturbing for parents, thinking about how their child is leading his/her life away from home. We at Peerozo have made many things possible for parents which are as follows* -:

* Entry time of your child in the hostel at the end of the day will be sent to you at the parent’s portal. 
* Reach out our 24*7 helpdesk in case of any problem & it will be resolved  as soon as possible. 
* A guardian in the form of an attendant will always be one phone call away from your child who will mentor as well as assist your child when he/she is in need.
* Moreover, there is a security guard in every apartment for security purposes and he will also keep track of the entry time of your child at the end of the day.

### Want to see your child?
It often happens in general hostels that parents are not allowed to meet with their Child for a longer duration but parents always want to see the place where their child lives and they also want to analyse the bonding of their child with his/her peers. We at Peerozo provide you the facility for a free stay of two days at your child’s flat/hostel in a month.
