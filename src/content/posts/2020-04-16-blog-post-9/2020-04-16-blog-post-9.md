And importantly the indepth solution we proposed, which has a very huge potential to capture a large market segment in no time. We have a unique Expansion Strategy which is a key point to the whole business Idea.
* You are going to invest in a business which is going to grow day by day unlike seasonal business because every year thousands of students will definitely come to coaching/ schools/ college hubs.
* All those students have one major problem. They are unable to get good quality PG or Hostels with a fair hygiene being maintained & healthy food option. There is no digital centralized network for easy access to these Pg/Hostels.
* We can easily compete with the other competitors because we are going to provide them good living space in flats and food at affordable prices which is quite possible as far as our model is concerned.
* Further, we are going to target all the PG/ Hostel to become our economy segment of Peerozo. Peerozo will enforce them to maintain quality standards and with Affordable Pricing to the Hostel/Pg owner, we will give them digital services and share our consumer base.

|*Apart from our personal gains & losses. It's most important to understand how you're going to contribute to a moral solution. Getting away from home is always a daunting experience for everyone (especially young ones). Changed schedule,  doing all arrangements by themselves, academic/ work backlog, distant touch from family results in stress and all pile up into a Home-Sick person. We all experience such reckless feelings in our lifetime, some get adapted soon and for some it damages productivity and causes failures.*|<img src = "https://github.com/peerozo/assets/blob/master/Blogs/Images/Study1.jpg?raw=true" width = "400"/>|
